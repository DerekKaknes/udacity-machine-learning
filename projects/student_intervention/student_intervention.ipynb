    "1) Gaussian Naive Bayes: Naive Bayes models can be used in a wide variety of classification problems.  They have been successfully applied to [email spam filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering) and [automated medical diagnostics](http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=itj.2012.1166.1174&org=11).  The strengths of Naive Bayes are that it can fit relatively small data sets and that its computational complexity scales linearly (so it can handle very large data sets without enormous computational times).  One weakness of NB is that it doesn't model interactions between features (non-linear relationships).  Another weakness of the model is that it can be skewed by scarce data points; for example, if a NB model encounters a testing observation in which one of its features presents a new value that was not encountered during training, then the model may assign a 0% probability to that outcome.  This model is potentially a good candidate for our problem because it can be trained and tested quickly and can identify linear relationships within the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Random Forest: Random Forest Decision Trees offer the simplicity of Decision Trees with safeguards against over-fitting through the use of ensembling shallower trees.  Random Forest has been used for many types of classification problems, including the classic [Titanic survival](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and [click stream analysis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06247.pdf).  The strengths of the Random Forest algorithm is that it can easily capture interactions between features and resists over-fitting through ensembling.  A main weakness of Random Forest is its relative opacity, particularly in comparison to a singular Decision Tree.  Random Forest could be a good candidate for our problem because of its ability to extract relationships between the features to contstruct more complex decision formulas.  However, our training set is relatively small, so Random Forest may not be able to leverage its ensembling quality as effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) SVM: Support Vector Classifers (SVC's) can be used to create highly complex and nonlinear decision boundaries, making them good candidates for high dimensionality classification problems, particularly those that are not linearly seperable.  SVC's have been used in [road detection](http://web.mit.edu/mobility/publications/Iagnemma_IVSS_10.pdf) problems for autonomous driving, [detection of microcalcifications](https://www.cse.unr.edu/~looney/cs773b/SVMmicrocalcification.pdf) as indicators of tumors in mammograms, and to predict [long-run changes in the price of technology stocks](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/saahil_madge.pdf).  The strenghts of the SVM is its ability to construct and apply complex, non-linear decision boundaries, giving it the ability to accurately learn complex relationships betweens features and target.  The weakness of the SVM is primarily its computational complexity, sometimes making it ill-suited for training on large data sets.  Additionally, if not properly cross-validated, the SVM's flexibility can lead to over-fitting the training set.  In this instance, the SVC is a good candidate for our problem because we have a relatively small data set with a potentially complex relationship between the features (student characteristics) and the target (passing status).  \n",
    "\n",
    "4) GradientBoostingClassifier: Similar to Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Classifiers (GBC's) utilizes ensembling techniques to improve a group of weak classifiers into a single strong classifier.  GBC's have been used in many traditional classification problems.  The strength of GBC are similar to Random Forest, but can potentially outperform by iteratively generating its weak classifiers, rather than generating them randomly.  GBC's perform well in many classification settings, but can be subject to over-fitting with smaller data sets.  GBC is a good candidate for our problem for similar reasons to the Random Forest (extracting feature relationships, relatively inexpensive training cost); however, without parameter tuning there is a risk that even the weak classifiers risk over-fitting our smaller training set."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given the size of the historical data set, training and prediction times were not significant factors in determining the ideal model.  Training times ranged from ~3 hundredths of a second to ~1 tenth of second.  However, we would note that computational complexity for SVM's can be very steep.  As an example of this, we ran a fourth simulation on the SVC with 10,000 data points (sampled from X_train with replacement) and found that the training time increased nearly 200-fold to ~2.2 seconds.  While 2.2 seconds is still a very reasonable training time, if we expected that the historical data set could be expanded signficantly - for example, if we gained access to a national data base - then the non-linear increase in training training times for SVC could become a stronger consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary motivation in support of the SVC model is its F1 score performance amongst both training and test data.  On the test data, the SVC - without parameter tuning - scored around 0.79 to 0.80, consistently.  Notably, this performance was superior to both the GaussianNB and RandomForestClassifier models, and roughly equivalent to the performance of the GradientBoostingClassifier (GBC). However, we note that the relatively large dispartity between the GBC's performance on the training set versus the testing set indicate a strong likelihood that the model is overfitting the training data and suffering from high variance.  If we had or expected access to more training data, then we could potentially combat this overfitting by increasing the training set size; however, given the small training set that we have available, it is most likely that our parameter tuning for the GBC would increase the bias in the model, which would likely bring down training performance and may or may not improve testing performance.  In the case of the SVC, however, there is relatively less drop-off between training and testing performance, which gives us greater confidence in its generalizability."
